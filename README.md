# JavaFXRibbon

This is a simple proejct that inclues a Ribbon component for JavaFX. It is heavily based on this original project by PixelDuke: https://www.pixelduke.com/fxribbon/

I decided to create my own version because tehre were some features that ribbon lacked. These features (which are partially supported in this project) are:
 - Being able to hide/show the ribbon, by using a small button or double-clicking the tabs.
 - Proper support for ribbon buttons, adapting the text to optimize the used space.
 - Support for a menu tab.
